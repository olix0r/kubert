## Features

* [`clap`](https://docs.rs/clap) command-line interface support
* A basic admin server with `/ready` and `/live` probe endpoints;
* A default Kubernetes client
* Graceful shutdown on `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` signals
* An HTTPS server (for admission controllers and API extensions) with certificate reloading
* A _requeue_ channel that supports deferring/rescheduling updates (i.e. in case a write fails).
* A [`Runtime`][rt] type that ties it all together!

### Why not `kube-rs`?

The [`kube`][krs] crate is great! And in fact, `kubert` builds on `kube`'s client and runtime
modules. This crate, however, captures some of the repeated patterns we've encountered building
controllers for [Linkerd](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2). It doesn't try to hide
`kube`--though it does reduce boilerplate around initializing watches and caches (reflectors); and
it expects you to schedule work via the `tokio` runtime.

## Examples

This repository includes a simple [example application](./examples) that demonstrates how to use a
`kubert::Runtime`.

Other examples include:
* [Linkerd2 policy controller](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/blob/d4543cd86e427b241ce961b50dd83b1738c0b069/policy-controller/src/main.rs)

## Status

This crate is still fairly experimental, though it's based on production code from Linkerd; and we
plan to use it in Linkerd moving forward.
